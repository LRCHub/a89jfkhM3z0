LADY：i think i only love your profile.
LORD：and i yours. you look nice from the side.
LADY：…were i you,
i would have said something better.
LORD：like what? i can find nothing to say.
"try to search for…"
LADY：you don't know me.
'cause you do not know yourself.
LORD：neither do you...look at yourself.
"try to search for my face of truth"
――so we touch each other strongly
after slight inquiry. and play our
trump card, and scar ourselves for life.
we are so fine. that is
exactly what we have really wanted.――
LADY：i know you better than you know yourself.
LORD：that's not possible.
after all, i've never known you.
"try to show me your face of truth."
――when i want to put my detector
deep inside you, just as now,
you shut off the one way in,
then hide it away, just as now.
what's more when you want to go out
i want to stay home, and
vice versa.――
"lovely!"
LADY：you know my profile better than i do,
i imagine, and vice versa.
LORD：i know your profile better than you,
i promise, and vice versa.
――but you'll you never see my front.
i'll never see your face.
and i'll never see your front,
you'll never see my face.――
